# Usage
The tool is located at the editor tab Tools->Shadow Baker.
 
# Parameters:
 -Target
 
 The target Transform of the object that you want to create a shadow.
 
 -Texture Size
 
 Shadow texture resolution. Higher means more quality but a larger file size.
 
 -Orthographic Scale
 
 Scale of the camera used for rendering the shadow. 
 Increase it if the shadow does not fit the image.
 
 -Blur Intensity/Iterations
 
 Gaussian blur effect for the shadow texture. Increase the iteration count if your texture has banding.
 
 -Bake Children
 
 Enable/disable children gameobjects appearing in the shadow.
